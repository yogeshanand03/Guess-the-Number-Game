# 🎯 Guess the Number Game (1–10)

This is a simple **Guess the Number** game built with **HTML**, **CSS**, and **JavaScript**. The goal is to guess a randomly generated number between **1 and 10**.

1. The game randomly selects a number between **1 and 10**.
2. Enter your guess and click the **Check** button.
3. You'll get feedback:
   - ✅ Correct: You win the game!
   - 🔼 Too high / 🔽 Too low: Try again, and your score decreases.
4. When your **score reaches 0**, the game ends.
5. Click the **Restart** button to play a new game.
